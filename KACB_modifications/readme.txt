The experiments after modifications on KACB methods have been carried on SemEval dataset for the year
2012 and 2017. The name and the explanation of the two sub-folders is given below:

FILE                          DETAILS
                       
1) exp_2012_dataset           This folder contains the code for running the experiments on SemEval 2012
                              English pair sentences dataset. The reason for running the experiments on 2012 dataset
                              was to compare our proposed modifications with the pre-existing work, which used
                              the SemEval dataset of the year 2012.
                       
2) exp_2017_dataset           This folder contains the code for running the experiments on SemEval 2017
                              English pair sentences dataset. The reason for running the experiments on 2012 dataset
                              was to compare our proposed modifications with the state-of-the-art work.
