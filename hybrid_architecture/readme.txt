The proposed hybrid architecture for calculating semantic textual similarity between two sentences combines Knowledge
and Corpus based techniques with CNN architecture,and the combined output is then given as an input two different types
of Regressor algorithm,i.e, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). Therefore, the description
of the two subfolders are given as:

FOLDER              DESCRIPTION

1) MLP              Contains a .ipynb file for implementing hybrid architecture with MLP as the Regressor.

2) SVR              Contains a .ipynb file for implementing hybrid architecture with MLP as the Regressor.
